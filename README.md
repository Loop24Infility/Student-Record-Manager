# Student-Record-Manager
Student Record Manager
Student Record Manager is a student data management system designed for efficient handling of academic records. Originally developed as part of my college C programming project, I revisited and enhanced it by rewriting the entire code in C++ while adding new functionalities and improving its structure. This project showcases my journey of refining a basic project into a more robust and functional application.

Features
Add, search, update, and delete records: Easily manage student information.
Sort records: Organize records by marks to identify top performers.
Calculate averages: Quickly compute the average marks of all students.
Export data: Save records to a text file for backup or sharing.
Authentication: Secure access with password protection.
Why This Project?
This project originated as a simple college assignment in C, focused on learning file handling and menu-driven applications. I later reimagined it, adding more advanced features and rewriting it in C++ to improve its functionality and code quality. It reflects my growth as a programmer and my ability to revisit and upgrade projects for practical use.

Technologies Used
Language: C++
File Handling: Binary and text file operations for persistent storage
Data Structures: Structs and vectors for record management
