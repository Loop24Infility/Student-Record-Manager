# **Student Record Manager**

**Student Record Manager** is a simple and efficient system for managing student academic records. Originally created as part of my college C project, I enhanced it by rewriting the code in C++ and adding new features. This project showcases the use of file handling, data structures, and menu-driven programming in C++.

## **Features**
- **Add, search, update, and delete student records**
- **Sort records by marks** to identify top scorers
- **Calculate the average marks** of all students
- **Export records** to a text file for backup or sharing
- **Password-protected access** for security

## **Why This Project?**
This project started as a basic college assignment in C. I later revisited it, transitioned to C++, and improved its functionality by adding new features. It highlights my growth as a programmer and my ability to refine projects for practical use.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: C++
- **File Handling**: Binary and text file operations
